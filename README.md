# divvy

67-442 iOS Engineering final project: A bill splitting app 

Some things I'd work on with more time:

* a way for users to delete meals they mistyped 
* more descriptive breakdown of meal costs on the final bill (being able to click on a cell and see a single user's details)
* image/scrollview autolayout issues!!!! 
* can't hit "divvy!" more than once on the same bill, calculations become wrong
